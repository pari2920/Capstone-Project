# Capstone Project
üöó Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

Capstone Project ‚Äì Summer Analytics 2025Hosted by Consulting & Analytics Club √ó Pathway

üìå Project Overview

Urban parking spaces are limited and often inefficiently priced. Static pricing leads to overcrowded lots or unused capacity. This project implements a real-time dynamic pricing engine for 14 urban parking lots, adapting prices based on demand, congestion, special events, and vehicle types.

We simulate real-time conditions using Pathway‚Äôs streaming data framework and implement three levels of pricing models using only NumPy and Pandas. Visualizations are built with Bokeh.

üß∞ Tech Stack

Python ‚Äì Core language
NumPy & Pandas ‚Äì Data preprocessing and modeling
Pathway ‚Äì Real-time data simulation and processing
Bokeh ‚Äì Visualization of live data streams
Google Colab ‚Äì Development and execution
Panel ‚Äì Interactive dashboarding (optional)

üß† Objective

Design a dynamic pricing system that:
Starts from a base price of $10
Adjusts prices smoothly based on real-time inputs:
Occupancy rate
Queue length
Traffic congestion
Special events
Vehicle type (bike, car, truck)
Competitor pricing (optional, advanced)
Supports rerouting logic if a lot is full

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Breakdown

1. Data Ingestion

Real-time stream simulated via Pathway
73-day data from 14 parking lots
18 time points/day (30-minute intervals from 8 AM‚Äì4:30 PM)

2. Feature Engineering
Normalize occupancy
Weight vehicle types: bike (0.5), car (1), truck (1.5)
Process traffic and event indicators

3. Pricing Models

Model 1: Baseline Linear
Price[t+1] = Price[t] + Œ± √ó (occupancy / capacity)

Model 2: Demand-Based Function
Demand = Œ±(occupancy/capacity) + Œ≤(queue) - Œ≥(traffic) + Œ¥(special_day) + Œµ(vehicle_type)
Price = Base √ó (1 + Œª √ó normalized_demand)

Model 3: Competitive Pricing (Optional)

Use lat-long to calculate nearby lots
Adjust price based on proximity and competitor rates
Suggest rerouting when full

üìä Visualization (Bokeh)

Real-time pricing trends per lot
Competitor comparison (if implemented)
Occupancy vs. Price curves
